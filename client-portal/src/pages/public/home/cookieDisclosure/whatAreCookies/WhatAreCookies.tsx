        <h2>2. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW TO DISABLE THEM?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. At Finalto BVI we use cookies on our website Tradx.com  (the “Website”) to allow the Website to recognise you on subsequent visits, or to authorise other designated websites to recognise you.<br/><br/>

Cookies can be used by us for other purposes. For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on our Website, to remember your user ID on our Website, and to help you navigate between pages more efficiently. Cookies can also be used by us to collect information about webpages visited and content viewed by you, links and buttons clicked, URLs visited before and after you visit our Website.
Much, though not all, of the data that is collected through cookies is anonymous, though some of it is designed to detect browsing patterns and approximate geographical location to improve your user experience.<br/><br/>

Most web browsers have cookies enabled and accept cookies automatically, but you can alter the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. Generally you have the option to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is issued or reject all cookies. Visit the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu on your browser to change settings. You can find more information about how to turn off cookies here: <a href='http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/' style={{color:'red'}} target='_blank'>http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ </a><br/><br/>
Please note that cookies can't harm your computer. We use encrypted information gathered from them to help improve your experience of the Website. For example, they help us to identify and resolve errors, or to determine relevant related products to show you when you're browsing.<br/>
Do not track (DNT) is a feature offered by some browsers, with some newer browsers offering it as default. If you enable it, it sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing isn't tracked.<br/>
We're giving you this information as part of our initiative to both comply with legislation, and make sure we're honest and clear about your privacy when using our Website.</p>
